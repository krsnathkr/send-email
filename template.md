Quick question about your team at [Company]


Hi [Name],

I hope you are doing well. My name is Krishna and I am a Computer Science student preparing for internship applications for summer 2026. I noticed you work as a [JobRole] at [Company], and I wanted to reach out because I am trying to understand how students usually break into your team or similar roles.

If you have a moment, could you share one or two pieces of advice for someone starting the process? Your insight would genuinely mean a lot to me and a quick reply from you would really make my day.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and hope your week is going well.
Best,
Krishna
