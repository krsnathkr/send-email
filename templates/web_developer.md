Subject: [Name], your insight could mean a lot for my next step.

Hi [Name],

I hope you are doing well. My name is Krishna and I am a CS graduate student exploring front end and full stack roles. I came across your profile while learning how people get started on the web development side at [Company], and your path stood out to me.

I am preparing for summer 2026 applications and want to understand what usually helps students break into web dev teams. I have been working as a GA Web Developer at SEMO, building reusable components, custom templates, and maintaining our university site across HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and VTL, but I know real world insight from someone in the field matters far more than what I read online.

If you have even a small piece of advice, it would genuinely help me shape my direction. Your reply would mean more than you might think.

Thank you for taking the time to read this,
Krishna
