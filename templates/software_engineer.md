Subject: [Name], your insight could mean a lot for my next step.

Hi [Name],

I hope your week has been going well. My name is Krishna and I am a CS student exploring software engineering roles for summer 2026. I came across your profile while trying to understand how people usually get started on the engineering side at [Company], and your journey caught my attention.

I am preparing for applications and wanted to ask what helped you or others stand out when moving into software engineering roles. I have been building projects across full stack development, machine learning systems, and backend pipelines, but I know that guidance from someone who has already navigated this path is far more valuable than anything I can learn from generic advice.

If you have even a small piece of advice, it would genuinely help me shape my direction. Your reply would mean more than you might think.

Thank you for taking the time to read this,
Krishna
