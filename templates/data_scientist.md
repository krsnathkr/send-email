Subject: [Name], your insight could mean a lot for my next step.

Hi [Name],

I hope your week has been going well. I am Krishna, a CS and Data Science student who has been trying to understand how people get started in data science teams at [Company]. Your background caught my eye because your path reflects where I hope to be one day.

I am preparing for summer 2026 applications and wanted to ask what helped you or others break into the data science side. I have worked on statistical modeling and won DataFest 2025 with my team, but I know that practical insight from someone who has lived this journey makes all the difference.

If you have even a small piece of advice, it would genuinely help me shape my direction. Your reply would mean more than you might think.

Thank you for taking the time to read this,
Krishna
