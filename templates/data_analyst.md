Subject: [Name], your insight could mean a lot for my next step.

Hi [Name],

I hope you are doing well. My name is Krishna and I am studying CS and Data Science. I found your profile while learning how students usually find their way into analyst roles at [Company], and your journey stood out to me.

I am preparing for summer 2026 applications and would love to understand what helped you or others stand out when applying to analyst teams. I have worked with large real world datasets and presented insights in competitions, but hearing from someone who has already taken this path would give me direction I cannot get elsewhere.

If you have even a small piece of advice, it would genuinely help me shape my direction. Your reply would mean more than you might think.

Thank you for taking the time to read this,
Krishna
