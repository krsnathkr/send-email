Subject: [Name], your insight could mean a lot for my next step.

Hi [Name],

I hope you are doing well. My name is Krishna and I am a graduate student focusing on applied machine learning. I came across your profile while trying to understand the ML teams at [Company], and your path really stood out to me.

I am preparing for summer 2026 applications and I am trying to learn how students usually break into ML roles at places like yours. I have worked on projects like a seven million review sentiment model and a real time YOLOv8 chess vision system, but I know that hearing from someone on the inside can guide me much better than any online resource.

If you have even a small piece of advice, it would genuinely help me shape my direction. Your reply would mean more than you might think.

Thank you for taking the time to read this,
Krishna
